Transactions go through three phases in the happy case:         1. Route Auction (offchain): User broadcasts to our network          signalling their desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids          containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a          certain time and price range.         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be          prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager`          contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This          transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chain. Upon          detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain,          router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the          receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of          liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending          amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the          transaction.         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the          receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a          relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may          be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager`          to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the          funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users          to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving          chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the          same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side,          unlocking the original `amount`.         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it          reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on          each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled          unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for          sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.","version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"vault/TransactionManager.sol":"TransactionManager"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":10000},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"vault/ProposedOwnable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x697eadaacaa2f8be0a504c35e2ff8ba9b218dd4e4ecbe68c6d9b0f6ec22be7f8","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://4258e044cb37e31fa8816cd42233905316c2af1db830fe3d65818ecf87b28660","dweb:/ipfs/QmWCHUJH4VJdj7dhBdeQMTeQcNY7CFC2zzFDo5xoiYpJcL"]},"vault/TransactionManager.sol":{"keccak256":"0xb3df8bea0e823691249778716f53dceaa1883897588b99a84caccf5b182ec14b","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://0cfd48cb1f5f577b30babfcd0e611e5a33838f2e5effa1c856e3c75ab5c38760","dweb:/ipfs/QmPib5M2AqyTjPAgyccBmJBWoqdMycy7gbYP4h4FpunGiK"]},"vault/interfaces/IFulfillInterpreter.sol":{"keccak256":"0xc4f919a383199141fb3fd522ed277d6de931aedece304cdd6b9aa7898a84ede7","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://e0db40b6a0be746777fb3937b15a01569681fd833be2d2ad4486c360f5810711","dweb:/ipfs/QmRBGHPuyDqpwWCNnpfR6985T15nBZr3TEgpBy67hCc17M"]},"vault/interfaces/ITransactionManager.sol":{"keccak256":"0xf854ed072ea790fbe90456404d7aa076201ebee897c27796589172f05c405c41","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://c2ab09601ebc1e12c335f4be53a6c40027b45c88094a6ffaeef876a752c21e92","dweb:/ipfs/Qmd7yqbxw5UVAB475AydvZF5V8CQ2hfmK9TkQoD3dqhjV8"]},"vault/interpreters/FulfillInterpreter.sol":{"keccak256":"0xcbb024846b940efa8815c717030c714a14b1e506553c672f42c5d3b6e092abbf","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://cf3118d1213c929377d12afb73ea516b96109bfa3211222a3e2981780201e6d5","dweb:/ipfs/QmR3zsgHf4i5rJiwYcxXc16z1U4nxXtYfUau7H4mett8ho"]},"vault/lib/LibAsset.sol":{"keccak256":"0x823b39fe0573f4522fef4f82e60c6e4770ca79cb13cb3b10c88545c6088e3f90","license":"UNLICENSED","urls":["bzz-raw://a4a57a2903ccc54e47140eb681515d3e338d4c6df5f5b85f72a5af18a41aa32c","dweb:/ipfs/QmX3mN5uCybZfpiL4aNW5XfMiR3orBPxY8wxih3SFZM4pC"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/Address.sol":{"keccak256":"0x3336baae5cf23e94274d75336e2d412193be508504aee185e61dc7d58cd05c8a","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://39a05eec7083dfa0cc7e0cbfe6cd1bd085a340af1ede93fdff3ad047c5fb3d8e","dweb:/ipfs/QmVApz5fCUq2QC8gKTsNNdCmcedJ3ETHp68zR5N3WUKS4r"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/Context.sol":{"keccak256":"0xbe2b1abcfaee001c5a4ae3b5274803e3f84e1312b1ef7e09265e040beac9c54a","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://3ab4a5f558658737bb61d1fa85a7d82acae467302fc8a4ef40dccfcf527a8688","dweb:/ipfs/QmaU2BAcwpgaBiKMcEK2f3rDg51ikwLh61sT9uU76XF6as"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/ECDSA.sol":{"keccak256":"0x46a0a615f0e2c10c54266e72fcb5c6e726f7e94100f0e79d6ed967ffb0c6c74f","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://9defa5a8c1b084c25615b2d2a627fc14bbe6bfdb7552ce437a6de7c3ebf6c55d","dweb:/ipfs/QmWgYRyBB5jZahVXgkU7dv4rB2DZqjXYMLNWSk5UVuhXX4"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/IERC20.sol":{"keccak256":"0x61437cb513a887a1bbad006e7b1c8b414478427d33de47c5600af3c748f108da","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://2c3d0973630ed74f2b5ce3944677a885dc70ec32fc83b35f55045a10224da32b","dweb:/ipfs/QmbefZ5RoEZKNHXCALfh683PnaNYzKPcKMFjyY1DVAgq8A"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/Ownable.sol":{"keccak256":"0xc9798f4a9c08aa45233d47fa103d1d6ba7c74edcf5a9900c209fe417aef11985","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://020d5154c18f8d4cd1902f625c5c61fea7417994a02d64f7b9840847dc085e07","dweb:/ipfs/QmUfSTCN8oPqDsF9JAdxNrTmLin21tS8daCFV4cFczicRA"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/ReentrancyGuard.sol":{"keccak256":"0x0e9621f60b2faabe65549f7ed0f24e8853a45c1b7990d47e8160e523683f3935","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://287a2f8d5814dd0f05f22b740f18ca8321acc21c9bd03a6cb2203ea626e2f3f2","dweb:/ipfs/QmZRQv9iuwU817VuqkA2WweiaibKii69x9QxYBBEfbNEud"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/SafeERC20.sol":{"keccak256":"0xe5b85114db93199790cd04085cba72bbf87d8dada7400bed8757ecea14f013c6","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://e39a677a7b91e54eda3ba0770dc3be27a9c37e6553545d99d648b572528871eb","dweb:/ipfs/QmSR3TeubNStzymrwWbn1yt4rYTLW5W3CXWatoXtDSKMRL"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xee51e36a5bc8b8614554486b032d0888184071d73169f3538f36561bf9367602","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://b822d673845af2f760d1d0c73614b699562b38f75d286bd98a484c8e6fe6f1b3","dweb:/ipfs/QmeBy79bEDpTDvsFLsdUpZStmN3jgNYKPDygz6iTYEcAvA"]},"vault/vendor/v0.8/Strings.sol":{"keccak256":"0x391d3ba97ab6856a16b225d6ee29617ad15ff00db70f3b4df1ab5ea33aa47c9d","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://d636ba90bbbeed04a1ea7fe9ec2466757e30fd38ba2ca173636dbf69a518735e","dweb:/ipfs/QmQwCB2BHnEuYR22PYt9HkpbgeFDhq4rHmaYqAZbX3WRC7"]}},"version":1}
