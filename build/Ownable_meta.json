By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This can later be changed with {transferOwnership}. This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.","kind":"dev","methods":{"constructor":{"details":"Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner."},"owner()":{"details":"Returns the address of the current owner."},"renounceOwnership()":{"details":"Leaves the contract without owner.
